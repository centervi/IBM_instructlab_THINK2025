This requires seamless integration, orchestration and data readiness. A new IBM CEO study shows that business leaders expect the growth rate of AI investments to more than double over the next two years, with most actively adopting AI agents and preparing to scale them. Yet their pace of investments has led to disconnected technology - and only 25% of AI initiatives have achieved the ROI they expected. IBM is combining hybrid technologies, agent capabilities and deep industry expertise from IBM Consulting to help businesses operationalize AI. \"The era of AI experimentation is over.

IBM estimates that over one billion apps will emerge by 2028, putting pressure on businesses to scale across increasingly fragmented environments. This requires seamless integration, orchestration and data readiness. A new IBM CEO study shows that business leaders expect the growth rate of AI investments to more than double over the next two years, with most actively adopting AI agents and preparing to scale them. Yet their pace of investments has led to disconnected technology - and only 25% of AI initiatives have achieved the ROI they expected. IBM is combining hybrid technologies, agent capabilities and deep industry expertise from IBM Consulting to help businesses operationalize AI. \"The era of AI experimentation is over. Today's competitive advantage comes from purpose-built AI integration that drives measurable business outcomes,\" said Arvind Krishna, Chairman and CEO, IBM. \"IBM is equipping enterprises with hybrid technologies that cut through complexity and accelerate production-ready AI implementations.\"", "document_outline": "Summary of the product announcement in IBM Think 2025", "domain": "IBM", "leaf_node_type": "knowledge", "icl_query_1": "While many companies are actively adopting AI agents and preparing to scale, according to the latest survey by IBM’s CEO announced at IBM Think 2025, what percentage of AI initiatives have achieved the expected ROI from AI investments?", "icl_response_1": "25%", "icl_query_2": "According to IBM Think 2025, how many apps does IBM predict will emerge by 2028?", "icl_response_2": "Over 1 billion.", "icl_query_3": "According to IBM Think 2025 and the latest CEO survey, by how much do business leaders expect AI investment growth to increase over the next two years?", "icl_response_3": "More than double.", "leaf_node_path": "knowledge_technology_IBM_Think_2025"}

Enterprises will be able to connect their AI apps and agents with their unstructured data using watsonx.data, which tests show can lead to 40% more accurate AI than conventional RAG.8 IBM is also introducing watsonx.data integration, a single-interface tool for orchestrating data across formats and pipelines, and watsonx.data intelligence, which uses AI-powered technology to extract deep insights from unstructured data.9 They will be available as standalone products, with select capabilities also available through watsonx.data - maximizing client choice and modularity.

IBM estimates that over one billion apps will emerge by 2028, putting pressure on businesses to scale across increasingly fragmented environments. This requires seamless integration, orchestration and data readiness. A new IBM CEO study shows that business leaders expect the growth rate of AI investments to more than double over the next two years, with most actively adopting AI agents and preparing to scale them. Yet their pace of investments has led to disconnected technology - and only 25% of AI initiatives have achieved the ROI they expected. IBM is combining hybrid technologies, agent capabilities and deep industry expertise from IBM Consulting to help businesses operationalize AI. \"The era of AI experimentation is over. Today's competitive advantage comes from purpose-built AI integration that drives measurable business outcomes,\" said Arvind Krishna, Chairman and CEO, IBM. \"IBM is equipping enterprises with hybrid technologies that cut through complexity and accelerate production-ready AI implementations.\"", "document_outline": "Summary of the product announcement in IBM Think 2025", "domain": "IBM", "leaf_node_type": "knowledge", "icl_query_1": "While many companies are actively adopting AI agents and preparing to scale, according to the latest survey by IBM’s CEO announced at IBM Think 2025, what percentage of AI initiatives have achieved the expected ROI from AI investments?", "icl_response_1": "25%", "icl_query_2": "According to IBM Think 2025, how many apps does IBM predict will emerge by 2028?", "icl_response_2": "Over 1 billion.", "icl_query_3": "According to IBM Think 2025 and the latest CEO survey, by how much do business leaders expect AI investment growth to increase over the next two years?", "icl_response_3": "More than double.", "leaf_node_path": "knowledge_technology_IBM_Think_2025"}
